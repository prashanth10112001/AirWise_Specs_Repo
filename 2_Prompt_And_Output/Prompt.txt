###  SIMILAR PAST CASES (if available)
These are previous situations with similar indoor temperature, humidity and PM2.5
that the user found uncomfortable. Use these patterns to improve your decision.

No similar past cases were found for this environment.

### YOUR PREVIOUS RECOMMENDATION WAS

    **Previous Actions Taken:**
    - AC: OFF at 25°C
- Ceiling Fan: Speed 3
- Window: CLOSED
- Door: CLOSED
- Exhaust Fan: N/A
- Recheck After: 15 min

    **Previous Rationale (short summary):**
    Indoor PM2.5 was (241), temperature 25.61°C, humidity 59.99%. The system attempted to improve air quality and comfort.

###  GOAL
You must analyze all the above data and **recommend appliance settings** that:
1. Improve thermal comfort (temperature & humidity balance, air movement).
2. Maintain healthy indoor air quality (minimize pollutants like CO₂, VOC, PM2.5).
3. Respect user health conditions (e.g., asthma → avoid dust or VOCs).
4. Respond to outdoor air conditions (e.g., close windows if outdoor AQI is poor).
5. Optimize energy efficiency without compromising comfort.
